This is the microv project README.

The entire thing is an HTML tree. Other than the index, each HTML is a game. 
I nailed the breakout, "raider", and "maze" ones. 

Looking at how little you need to have for the game to work. 
Looking at how the original games were done. 
A little bit of nostalgia.
